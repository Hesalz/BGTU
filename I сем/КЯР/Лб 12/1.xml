        <content> Balaalo herdsmen have been ordered out of the greater northern Uganda as a presidential directive to evict them starts to bite, amid pockets of hostilities against them by the local communities.In Amuru District, for example, a group of security operatives led by the Amuru Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Mr Stephen Odong Latek, at the weekend combed villages in Okidi Parish where President Museveni visited recently, to remind the herdsmen with unfenced land, and those without water sources, to leave.Several herdsmen that the leaders met appealed for a week’s grace period to finish fencing their land, which process was incomplete.However, Mr Latek insisted that it was only the President to extend the grace period since they were working on his orders.“We shall first evict all of them and they can be vetted later to come back,” he said.Whereas the exercise overseen by security leaders kicked off peacefully on Saturday evening, two separate incidents of violence and vandalism against the Balaalo herdsmen have been recorded in Amuru and Gulu districts.The army arrested and handed over to police at least 15 people suspected of causing chaos.Maj Telesphor Turyamumanya, the UPDF 4th Division spokesman, said the suspects were taken to Gulu Central Police Station (CPS) </content>
